# Space-Invader
A pc game

This is my first made pc game. I tried my best but still there are some bugs. I uploaded the main python file as one can fix my bugs.

Rules of teh game is nothing but shooting the alien. SPACE key will help you to shoot. LEFT ARROW key and the RIGHT ARROW key will make you move. 
After every 20 points number of enemies will be increased. And game will be completed after 100 points. If you get touched by the space aliens game will be over.

The game logic was translated from the original Python/Pygame version, and it uses the same assets (images, sounds) from that version.
The core gameplay, including scoring, difficulty progression, and controls (Arrow keys for movement, Spacebar to shoot), remains the same.
